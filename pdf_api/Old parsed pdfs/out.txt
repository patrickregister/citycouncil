Rezoning Petition: 2014-053 by Charlotte-Mecklenburg 
Planning Department
Summary of Petition:  The petition proposes to:
1) modify the name of mobile food vending service;
2) allow the use in additional zoning districts, with prescribed conditions, as either a   principal or 

accessory use; and

3) modify the prescribed conditions for mobile food vending.

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 7-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Centers, Corridors and Wedges 
Growth Framework goals, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and 
because:

§

§
§

The amendment expands the employment base and broadens the economy to include emerging 
industries; 
The mobile food vending regulations protect existing neighborhoods;
The use and regulations create walkable places that are vibrant and have a variety of activities.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because the proposed text amendment:

§
§

§

§

§

§

Balances the mobile food vending industry interests with the community interests; and
Expands the zoning districts where mobile food vendors can locate allowing new mobile food 
vending opportunities for vendors and customers; and
Reduces the separation distances required to residential uses by building upon the separation 
distances established for similar uses such as eating/drinking/entertainment establishments; and
Expands the initial permit validity period to 365 consecutive days, thereby reducing the number of 
permits or permit extensions required per year on each site; and 
Adds new provisions allowing the gathering of four or more mobile food vendors (also known as 
rallies) on sites, allowing mobile food vending organizers to plan social events which add to the 
vibrancy of the area, and to create walkable places; and
Adds new provisions allowing mobile food vending special events in residential and institutional 
districts as an accessory use on     non-residential lots, and to allow such uses as schools and 
religious institutions the opportunity to host mobile food vending events on their site; and

§ Modifies the parking requirements to provide additional parking for customers, thereby reducing 

the parking impacts on surrounding areas.

Rezoning Petition: 2016-097 by Simonini Saratoga Foxcroft, 
LLC
Location:  Approximately 6.32 acres located on the east side of Sharon Lane between Providence Road 
and Heathmoor Lane. (Council District 6 - Smith)

Current Zoning: R-3 (single family residential)
Proposed Zoning: UR-2(CD) (urban residential, conditional) 

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff: Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the South District Plan, based in 
information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§
§

The plan recommends residential land use; and
The proposed density increase over three units per acre is supported by the criteria in the plan.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The subject site is located adjacent to the Cotswold Mixed Use Activity Center and abuts a large 
institutional land use (St. Gabriel Catholic Church); and
The proposed development provides a transition between the institutional use and the adjacent 
established single family residential development located north and west of the site; and
The site plan is limited to a maximum of 24 duplex (single family attached) dwelling units in up to 
12 buildings at a density of 3.8 units per acre; and
The proposed density is supported by the General Development Policies, which indicate a potential 
for a density up to 12 dwelling units per acre; and
The proposal meets the criteria described in the district plan for an increase in density from three 
to four units per acre. The proposal meets these criteria as follows:
§

Location: The site is within ½ mile of the Cotswold Mixed Use Activity Center, which includes a 
concentration of retail and office development.

§ Water and Sewer:  Charlotte Water will serve the subject site with water and sewer.
§

Open space: The duplex units are clustered in order to provide a “central green.” In addition, a 
tree save area is provided along the Sharon Lane frontage.
Streetscape Amenities: The proposal provides a 24-foot planting strip (extra width for a future 
bike lane) and a six-foot sidewalk along Sharon Lane. The project also provides an internal 
private street with sidewalks and a minimum of six, on-street, visitor parking spaces; and

§

§

Compatibility: The proposed development includes a number of elements to make the new 

housing compatible with the existing neighborhood along Sharon Lane. These include large 
setbacks consistent with the established setback on Sharon Lane; a 40-foot rear yard abutting 
the single family development to the west; and building and architectural commitments, 
including elevations and height limitations, which result in structures which resemble large 
single family homes.

Rezoning Petition: 2016-123 by Harbor Baptist Church
Location:  Approximately 9.81 acres located on the east side of Reedy Creek Road and Interstate 485 at 
the end of Saddlehorse Lane near the intersection of Gelding Drive and Saddlehorse Lane. (Outside City 
Limits)

Current Zoning: R-3 (single family residential)
Proposed Zoning: INST (CD) (institutional, conditional)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 7-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff disagrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be inconsistent with the Rocky River Road Area Plan, 
based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends residential uses up to 12 units per acre; however, area plans typically do not 
designate all locations for institutional uses.  The proposed site plan is also inconsistent with the 
area plan’s recommendation to extend Saddlehorse Lane to Reedy Creek Road.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§
§

§

The institutional use is not generally inconsistent with the area plan; and
There are two existing entrances to the abutting neighborhood from Harrisburg Road and Robinson 
Church Road; and
The creation of a public multi-use walking path is within the public interest.

Rezoning Petition: 2016-124 by Chris Ogunrinde
Location:  Approximately 1.50 acres located on the northwest corner at the intersection of Freedom Drive 
and Wesley Village Road. (Council District 3 - Mayfield)

Current Zoning: MUDD-O (mixed use development, optional)
Proposed Zoning: MUDD-O SPA (mixed use development, optional, site plan amendment)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Bryant Park Land Use & 
Streetscape Plan; however, inconsistent with the specific limitation from the previously approved 
conditional plan for building size and height because:

§
§

The plan recommends a mix of residential, office, and/or retail uses; and
The proposal increases the building height from 65 feet to 90 feet and the maximum building size 
from 20,000 square feet to 76,000 square feet.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

The site was part of a larger development plan, rezoned under petition 2007-068, which was 
consistent with the Bryant Park Land Use & Streetscape Plan. The 2007 rezoning reserved the 
subject site for 20,000 square feet of retail and/or office use with a maximum building height of 65 
feet served by surface parking; and
The proposed rezoning will amend the entitlements for this challenging site. With utilities 
remaining in the former Thrift Road right-of-way on the western side of the property, the proposed 
site plan places surface parking in this area where buildings are not feasible; and
The site is appropriate for the proposed mid-rise, mixed use building due to its urban location 
along a major thoroughfare; and

§

Additionally, the site is approximately 300 feet from the nearby single family homes in the Wesley 
Heights neighborhood and separated by the buffer created by Stewart Creek and the Stewart Creek 
Greenway; and
§

The proposed building will provide a visual anchor for the emerging FreeMoreWest area.

Rezoning Petition: 2016-146 by Barringer Capital, LLC
Location:  Approximately 0.74 acres located on the north side of West Tremont Avenue between South 
Tryon Street and Hawkins Street.  (Council District 3 - Mayfield)

Current Zoning: I-2 (general industrial)
Proposed Zoning: TOD-RO (transit oriented development-residential, optional)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-1 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the majority of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the South End Transit Station Area 
Plan, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends mixed-use transit supportive development for the area in which the site is 
located.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The subject site is within a 1/4 mile walk of the East/West Boulevard Transit Station on the LYNX 
Blue Line; and
The proposal allows a site previously used for industrial/office purposes to be redeveloped with a 
residential transit supportive project; and
The site plan supports increased connectivity by providing a new north/south street between 
Tremont Avenue and the site’s northern boundary; and
The proposal supports pedestrian and streetscape design by placing usable open space near the 
front of the site with units designed to front along West Tremont Avenue; and
This petition will help support the transition of the area to a more walkable transit district.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-018 by Robert Puckett and Steven 
Mozeley
Location:  Approximately 5.96 acres located on the northwest quadrant of the intersection of Old Plank 
Road and Brookshire Boulevard. (Council District 2 - Austin)

Current Zoning: R-3 (LWPA) (single family, Lake Wylie Protected Area) and O-1(CD) (LWPA) (office, 
conditional, Lake Wylie Protected Area)
Proposed Zoning: BD (CD) (LWPA) (distributive business, conditional, Lake Wylie Protected Area) with 
five-year vested rights

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 7-0 recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be inconsistent with the Northwest District Area Plan, 
based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends office and residential uses for this site.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

The subject property is located at the intersection of Brookshire Boulevard and Plank Road, and the 
majority of the site is currently zoned for office use; and
The properties to the north and south of the site are zoned predominately for non-residential uses; 
and
A low impact commercial use, such as self-storage, is appropriate for this site because:
a) The site plan associated with the proposed development visually buffers the site from 

Brookshire Boulevard and the residential properties located on the eastern side of the highway 
through the use of a fence with screening shrubs. This treatment is in addition to the 
preservation of the trees within the right-of-way along the Brookshire Boulevard frontage;

b) Along the western side of the property, a creek along with a 57-foot buffer will provide 

protection for the adjacent single family properties; and

c) The proposed buildings fronting on Old Plank Road are designed to look like office buildings, 

with windows, changes in materials and architectural features to break up building walls. 
These buildings will screen the more traditional storage buildings.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-022 by Shayna Jerrell
Summary of Petition:  The petition proposes to modify the definition of outdoor recreational uses 
regarding street frontage requirements for temporary structures.

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 7-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Centers, Corridors and Wedges

hearing, and because:

§

The amendment protects existing neighborhoods.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

six months in a calendar year,

The existing definition for outdoor recreational uses currently limits temporary enclosures for 
swimming pools to:
1)
2) no more than 30 feet in height, and
3)
Eliminates the requirement that the lot on which the enclosure is located must front on a 
thoroughfare; and  
Allows neighborhood swim clubs that may not be located on a major or minor thoroughfare to 
operate in colder weather with a temporary enclosure; and

frontage on a thoroughfare;  

§ Will not negatively impact residential neighborhoods because the prescribed conditions for outdoor 

recreational uses that abut a residential area require a 100-foot separation distance and a “Class 
C” buffer to mitigate any negative impacts on abutting properties.

retail, the subject property is currently zoned for residential development; and

The primary building on the site is designed to be compatible with the abutting residential, with a 
height limit of three stories and 50 feet, consistent with the area plan’s height recommendation.  
The development is also separated from the abutting residential by a creek; and
The petition proposes to redevelop a vacant infill site, thereby minimizing environmental impacts 
while accommodating growth; and
The proposed development will support future area connectivity by providing a public street 
connection to abutting property located to the west of the site.

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL if this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be inconsistent and consistent with the Central District 
Plan and the General Development Policies, based on information from the staff analysis and the public 
hearing, and because:

§

§

§

The plan recommends multi-family dwellings for the portion of the site proposed to be rezoned to 
allow retail uses; and
The plan recommends residential dwelling units for the portion of the site for which seven 
residential dwelling units are proposed; and
The General Development Policies support a residential density of 12.15 units per acre.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on the information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

This petition is part of Brightwalk, which is a new urban neighborhood located off of Statesville

The proposed rezoning will amend the entitlements for the site, replacing 75 age-restricted 
multi-family dwellings and 37 multi-family units with seven residential dwellings and 20,000 
square feet of non-residential uses; and
Although the proposed nonresidential uses are inconsistent with the area plan recommendation for  
multi-family dwellings, the area within Brightwalk which was previously rezoned for non-residential 
development has subsequently been developed with residential uses; and
The proposed retail component will provide walkable, neighborhood oriented commercial uses for 
Brightwalk; and
The rezoning also accommodates the future realignment of Newland Road and Norris Avenue,

Location:  Approximately 0.77 acres on the southeast corner at the intersection of Ridge Road and Brice 
Knoll Lane. (Council District 4 - Phipps)

Current Zoning: CC (commercial center)
Proposed Zoning: NS (neighborhood services)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent and inconsistent with the Prosperity Hucks 
Area Plan, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

The plan recommends a mix of uses including retail/service, office, and institutional uses for the 
area in which this site is located; and
The proposed drive-through facilities are inconsistent with the plan recommendation for no 
additional drive-through facilities at this location.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information 
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

This property is located in the Prosperity Village Area which is intended to be a walkable, 
mixed-use activity center; and
The area plan does not support an additional drive-through facility at this location because, 
typically, a drive-through use would not support pedestrian activity; and
However, in this case the proposed building has been designed to be pedestrian oriented and 
minimize the impact of the accessory drive-through by:
a) Placing the use with a drive-through in a multi-tenant building;
b) Providing a canopy for the drive-through area to give the appearance of extending the building 

along the street;

c) Committing to a screen wall on Ridge Road to separate the sidewalk from the vehicular area; 

and

d) Placing the building at the back of sidewalk and prohibiting maneuvering between the building 

and street; and

§

As designed, the proposed retail development will provide neighborhood services for nearby 
residents.
