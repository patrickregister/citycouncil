Rezoning Petition: 2016-076 by The Drakeford Company
Location:  Approximately 1.35 acres located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Holt Street
and East 36th Street. (Council District 1 - Kinsey)

Current Zoning: UR-2(CD) (urban residential, conditional)
Proposed Zoning: UR-2(CD) TS (urban residential, conditional, transit supportive overlay)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Central District Plan, based on
information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends multi-family dwellings for that site.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

The adopted area plan recommends multi-family residential uses as amended by Petition 2015-89
that allowed 51 multi-family dwelling units in one structure, at a density of 37.7 units per acre;
and
The proposed development replaces current entitlements by decreasing the number of units
allowed to 32 units and the overall density to 23.7 units per acre; and
Building height and form are consistent with recent developments along East 36th Street and are
designed to be compatible with the abutting residential with a height limit of 45 feet and four
stories.   All parking is internal to the site; and
Site layout will retain an existing heritage tree located along East 36th Street.

Rezoning Petition: 2016-134 by CapRock, LLC
Location:  Approximately 5.81 acres located on the north side of Joy Street between Ashley Road and
Wilson Avenue. (Council District 3 - Mayfield)

Current Zoning: B-1(neighborhood business) and R-12MF (multi-family residential)
Proposed Zoning: UR-2(CD) (urban residential, conditional), five-year vested rights

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff disagrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee due to the number of outstanding
issues, the proposed density and the project being out of character with the surrounding residential area.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found the majority of the proposed multi-family to be consistent with the
Central District Plan; a small portion of the site to be inconsistent with the Central District Plan; and
the density to be inconsistent with the General Development Policies (GDP), based on information from
the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§
§

§

The plan called for multi-family development on the majority of this site; and
The plan recommends retail land uses for a small portion of the site proposed for multi-family
uses; and
The GDPs (General Development Policies) recommend up to 17 units per acre not 22.7 units per
acre as proposed.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

The City has committed to 5,000 affordable housing units over the next three years; and
The urgent need for affordable housing is in the public interest; and

§
§
§ While 22 dwelling units per acre is well beyond the recommended 17 dwelling units per acre, some
of the density will be utilized towards the age-restricted units which tend to be smaller in size; and
The proposal will result in less trips than by right development.

Rezoning Petition: 2016-150 by CW Development
Location:  Approximately 4.13 acres located on the west side of Old Providence Road near the
intersection of Old Providence Road and Old Providence Lane.
(Council District 6 - Smith)

Current Zoning: R-3 (single family residential)
Proposed Zoning: UR-2(CD) (urban residential, conditional)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the South District Plan, and the
proposed density of 4.84 dwelling units per acre is supported by the General Development Policies
locational criteria, and because:

§

§

The plan recommends residential uses at a density of up to three dwellings per acre. The plan
references the residential location criteria of the General Development Policies for areas of higher
density development; and
The petition meets the General Development Policies locational criteria for consideration of up to
six dwellings per acre.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The site is located between Brookdale Continuing Care Retirement Community and Gladedale
Apartments to the north and a single family neighborhood to the south, and provides a transition
from the institutional and multi-family uses to the single family residential neighborhood; and
Increasing the density from three dwelling units per acre to 4.84 dwelling units per acre allows four
additional dwelling units be constructed on the site and is consistent with the adopted land use
policies for the area; and
The proposed UR-2(CD) (urban residential, conditional) district is appropriate as it allows flexibility
in site design including the preservation of an existing pond on the site; and
The pond will serve as an open space element and will also provide greater separation between the
proposed townhomes and the existing single family home west of the site; and
The petition provides a site design that is compatible with the abutting the single family
neighborhood by incorporating the following commitments:
§

A 40-foot building setback with an 18-foot wide landscaped area behind the sidewalk along Old
Providence Lane and a 20-foot building setback with a 10-foot wide landscaped area behind
the sidewalk along Old Providence Road.
Side and rear yards, and buffers, that are not required in the UR-1 (urban residential) district
and comparable to the requirements for the abutting R-3 (single family residential) zoning.
Units oriented to the internal private road and not Old Providence Lane, consistent with the
existing single family homes on the south side of Old Providence Lane which are oriented to
side streets.

Miller
Location:  Approximately 0.39 acres located on the southwest corner at the intersection of Monroe Road
and Ross Moore Avenue. (Council District 5 - Ajmera)

Current Zoning: 0-2 (office)
Proposed Zoning: B-1(CD) (neighborhood business, conditional), five-year vested rights

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Independence Boulevard Area
Plan, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The area plan recommends office and retail uses.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The subject property is located along the Monroe Road corridor, near a future pedestrian oriented
retail node where the adopted area plan encourages adaptive reuse of existing residential
structures; and
The majority of nearby properties fronting Monroe Road are developed with nonresidential office
uses; and
The petition proposes to reuse an existing residential structure for moderate intensity
nonresidential use; and
No building expansions are proposed and the existing trees in the front yard will be retained
thereby preserving the residential character while allowing the area to transition to nonresidential
use; and
A new planting strip and sidewalk along Monroe Road will be added and parking will be located to
the rear or side of the existing structure which will support the desired pedestrian oriented
development form.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-015 by Manna Capital, LLC
Location:  Approximately 1.07 acres located on the north side of Rexford Road near the intersection of
Roxborough Road and Rexford Road. (Council District 6 - Smith)

Current Zoning: O-15(CD) (office, conditional)
Proposed Zoning: MUDD (CD) (mixed use development, conditional)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the SouthPark Small Area Plan, based
on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends office or a mix of office and residential uses.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

§

§

The Centers, Corridors and Wedges Growth Framework identifies SouthPark as a Mixed Use Activity
Center, a priority area for urban, pedestrian-oriented development; and
The new office building will enhance the pedestrian environment by providing an active use
oriented to the public sidewalk with parking to the rear on Rexford Road, eliminating an existing
bank drive-through and existing parking between the building and street; and
The site plan provides a wide setback along Rexford Road to preserve existing mature trees and
provide added green space. This is consistent with other recently approved rezoning’s and supports
the concept of a “green ribbon” along streets in the SouthPark area, as discussed in the recent
Urban Land Institute study; and
The development provides a transition in development intensity from the existing office buildings
west of the site to the residential condominium development east of the site with the following
provisions:
Limits the maximum building height of one-story (maximum of 40-feet) and 6,650 square feet.
The office building west of the site is five-stories and 76,620 square feet. The existing
condominium buildings on the other side of the site are two stories and range in size from
approximately 5,000 square feet up to approximately 13,000 square feet.
Provides a 10.5-foot wide “Class C” buffer with a minimum six-foot tall screen wall along the
eastern property line abutting the condominiums.
Proposes the area to the rear of the site, between the office building parking lot and the
condominiums, to be utilized for possible tree save.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-016 by Selwyn Property Group
Location:  Approximately 13.18 acres located on the west side of East Independence Boulevard generally
surrounded by Monroe Road, Idlewild Road, Independence Boulevard and Long Avenue. (Council District 5
- Ajmera)

Current Zoning: R-4 (single family residential), O-1 and O-2 (office), B-1(CD) (neighborhood business,
conditional) and B-2 (general business)
Proposed Zoning: MUDD-O (mixed use development, optional) and NS (neighborhood services)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff recommends approval upon resolution of the outstanding issues.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Independence Boulevard Area
Plan’s, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The area plan recommends mixed use development.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The subject site will serve as a transition between the more auto-oriented environment around the
interchange of Independence Boulevard and Idlewild Road, and the desired pedestrian oriented
environment along Monroe Road; and
The site plan allows for a mix of uses on the site, including retail and office, as called for in the
area plan; and
The proposed development along Monroe Road will facilitate the desired pedestrian oriented
environment on that street by placing the buildings near the sidewalk, not allowing parking
between the buildings and the street, establishing pedestrian connections to the buildings from the
sidewalk along Monroe Road, and providing an urban open space at the corner; and
The proposed development along Idlewild Road is designed to be more auto-oriented, consistent
with the nature of Idlewild Road in this location and the connection of an on/off ramp to
Independence Boulevard; and
The proposed site plan supports connectivity in the area by establishing an enhanced street
network with smaller blocks and pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-017 by NODA Terrace, LLC
Location:  Approximately 0.23 acres located on the southeast corner of the intersection of North
Davidson Street and East 37th Street.  (Council District 1 - Kinsey)

Current Zoning: UR-3(CD) (urban residential, conditional)
Proposed Zoning: UR-3(CD) SPA (urban residential, conditional, site plan amendment)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPOVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff recommends approval of this petition.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be inconsistent with the Blue Line Extension Transit
Station Area Plan, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§
§
§

The plan recommends single family residential uses up to five units per acre.
The plan recommends an increased setback and lower height limitations.
The proposed development exceeds the 40-foot height limit set forth in the adopted area plan.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

§

The adopted plan calls for single family for the subject property;  however, current entitlements
per rezoning petition 2005-160 already allow 8,000 square feet of office/retail uses and eight
dwelling units to be built on the subject site; and
The site is currently vacant and is located with ½ mile of the 36th Street Station of the LYNX Blue
Line Extension; and
The proposed development will not remove established single family uses, and will not encroach
into the abutting single family residential neighborhood; and
The proposed development is located adjacent to urban townhome and apartment projects in
transit oriented and urban residential zoning districts along North Davidson Street; and
This development will provide ground floor commercial uses that could serve the nearby residents;
and
The site design for the proposed development supports walkability in the area by locating the
building at the back of the sidewalk and placing parking away from the site frontage.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-019 by Steele-Trojan Properties, LLC
Location:  Approximately 15.481 acres northwest of Steele Creek Road and east of Outlets Boulevard
along Trojan Drive. (Outside City Limit and Council District 3 - Mayfield)

Current Zoning: R-3(LLWPA) (single family residential, Lower Lake Wylie Protected Area) and CC
(commercial center, Lower Lake Wylie protected area)
Proposed Zoning: NS LLWPA (neighborhood services, Lower Lake Wylie Protected Area) and O-2(CD)
LLWPA (office, conditional, Lower Lake Wylie Protected Area)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff recommends approval of this petition upon the resolution of the outstanding issues.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee finds the majority of this petition to be inconsistent and the smaller portion of
the property to be consistent with the Dixie Berryhill Strategic Plan,  based on information from the
staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

The  plan recommends employment mixed-use office/retail/light industrial for the majority of the
site; and
The plan recommends office/retail land uses for portion of the site zoned CC (commercial center)
as amended by petition 2013-001.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The site is located at the Steele Creek Road/Interstate 485 Interchange between the interchange
and the Charlotte Premium Outlet Mall; and
The Dixie Berryhill Strategic Plan anticipated office and light industrial development on this site
due to its close proximity to the Airport and the I-485 Interchange; and
However, the approval of rezoning petition 2013-021 for the Outlet Mall, has changed the
development pattern in the area to be more focused on retail service uses, instead of light
industrial uses; and
The size of the site and its location adjacent to the Outlet Mall and the I-485 interchange, lends
itself to more retail and office uses instead of light industrial which require much larger acreage;
and
Retail services at this location are appropriate considering recent development in the area, and its
proximity to the interchange and the Outlet Mall.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-026 by Belk Gambrell Enterprises,
LLC
Location:  Approximately 1.19 acres located on the north side of Fairview Road between Park Road and
Wintercrest Lane.  (Council District 6 - Smith)

Current Zoning: UR-C (CD) (urban residential - commercial, conditional)
Proposed Zoning: UR-C (CD) SPA (urban residential - commercial, conditional, site plan amendment)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be inconsistent with the SouthPark Small Area Plan,
based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§
§

The plan recommends multi-family residential uses as amended by a prior rezoning petition; and
The prior rezoning contained a specific condition allowing office use of the existing house.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

The subject is located along Fairview Road just west of the SouthPark Mixed Use Activity Center.
The Fairview Road frontage has intensified over time from single family to a mix of residential
types, with single family neighborhoods directly behind; and
Reuse of existing residential structures for office use along major transportation routes has been
seen as a way to provide a compatible transition to adjoining neighborhoods by preserving
character and scale; and
The proposed use of the property as an office, limited to the existing building and a smaller
additional structure at residential scale to the rear, provides a compatible transition from  Fairview
Road to the single family homes abutting the site; and
The existing house on the site is highly regarded in the area as a historic element, although not
officially designated by any organization. This rezoning proposal will preserve the structure; and
The existing zoning would allow a 10-story residential structure to be built on this site. This is out
of character with the adjoining single family neighborhood and with other two- to three-story
multi-family residential properties along Fairview Road. If approved, this rezoning proposal will
remove this potential inconsistency.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-031 by Lat Purser & Associates, Inc.
Location:  Approximately 1.146 acres located on the southeast corner at the intersection of North
Davidson Street and East 24th Street.  (Council District 1 - Kinsey)

Current Zoning: I-1 (light industrial)
Proposed Zoning: TOD-M (O) (transit oriented development - mixed use, optional)

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Blue Line Extension Transit Station
Area Plans, but does not meet the adopted streetscape within the plan based on information from the
staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The area plan recommends transit oriented development for the site.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

§

§

The site is currently located outside of the one-half mile walk distance to the 25th Street Transit
Station on the LYNX Blue Line Extension.  However, this site will be located within a one-half mile
walk of the station once the 25th Street Neighborhood Improvement Project has been constructed;
and
The proposed nonresidential uses are appropriate in a transit station area and compatible with
other uses along the North Davidson Street corridor; and
Development proposes to retain and improve existing buildings, which will not exceed the 50-foot
maximum height as recommended in the adopted area plan, and the scale and massing of these
buildings is compatible with and sensitive to the existing abutting neighborhood to the rear; and
A rear yard and additional wooded area will also provide a transition to the neighborhood adjacent
to the site; and
Though technically inconsistent with the recommended streetscape in the area plan, the proposed
streetscape improvements along North Davidson Street will begin to provide better pedestrian

Rezoning Petition: 2017-032 by Alliance Residential
Company
Location:  Approximately 10.04 acres at the northwest corner at the intersection of Wilkinson Boulevard
and Suttle Avenue. (Council District 3 - Mayfield)

Current Zoning: I-2 (general industrial)
Proposed Zoning: MUDD-O (mixed use development, optional), five-year vested rights

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 5-1 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the majority of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be consistent with the Bryant Park Land Use and
Streetscape Plan, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends a mix of residential, office, and retail for this site and the surrounding area.

§

Therefore, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§
§

§

§

The subject site is located on the former Radiator Specialty industrial property; and
The Bryant Park Land Use & Streetscape Plan called for the former and mostly vacant industrial
site, which includes the subject property, to be redeveloped with a mix of uses to include office,
multi-family and retail; and
The addition of multi-family development on this site will begin to create the mix of uses
recommended by the area plan and will  complement the County owned office building across
Suttle Avenue and the charter school located north of the site; and
The proposed development will also help to implement the desired vehicular and pedestrian
connectivity for the larger area by providing segments of two new streets and locating buildings
close to the sidewalk to support walkability.

Rezoning Petition: 2017-034 by Saussy Burbank, LLC
Location:  Approximately 1.6 acres located on the west side of Suttle Avenue between Wilkinson
Boulevard and Isom Street.  (Council District 3 - Mayfield)

Current Zoning: O-1 (office)
Proposed Zoning: MUDD (CD) (mixed use development, conditional), five-year vested rights

Zoning Committee Recommendation:
The Zoning Committee voted 6-0 to recommend APPROVAL of this petition as modified.

Staff Recommendation:
Staff agrees with the recommendation of the Zoning Committee.

Statement of Consistency:
§

The Zoning Committee found this petition to be inconsistent with the Bryant Park Land Use &
Streetscape Plan, based on information from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

The plan recommends office uses for the site as amended by rezoning petition 2013-045.

§

However, this petition was found to be reasonable and in the public interest, based on information
from the staff analysis and the public hearing, and because:

§

§

§

§

The Bryant Park Land Use & Streetscape Plan originally recommended a mix of residential, office,
and retail for the area where the site is located, which is the former Radiator Specialty industrial
site; and
The office land use recommendation was a result of rezoning petition 2013-045 which allowed for
all uses in the O-1 (office) district on this site and on abutting property; and
The proposed development of townhomes on this site will support the creation of a district with a
mix of residential, office and retail and will complement the County owned office building across
Suttle Avenue and the charter school located north of the site; and
The proposed development is also designed to support walkability in the new multi-use district,
with the residential units located near the public sidewalk and directly accessible from the
sidewalk.
